# About the project
I took the base project from my teacher Angela Yu and implemented new features, 
a little javascript was added to show/hide some elements on the front-end, an animated button, 
an option for the user to interact in a publication,
several other small details were added for me, check it out better by clicking on [GeehBlog](https://geehblog.vercel.app/).
